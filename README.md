# VirusAR
An open-sourced augmented reality web application for educational purposes surrounding structural biology.

VirusAR implements Google's Model Viewer to allow students, faculty and interested users to view 3D models of virus capsids (containers for crucial viral replication information) in augmented reality. Google's Model Viewer is a well-codumented, customizable and easy to implement Google API that will allow those wanting to create their own visualizations the ability to change the source code according to their preferences. In early development, we encountered a few problems relating to the deployment of Google's Model Viewer on different types of phones but as of now we have managed to successfully provide functionality of the web application to iPhones and Androids (specify types here). Additionally, with certain virus capsids being large models (exceeding millions of atoms), the triangulation of polygons composing the 3D model had to be decreased in order to view the model with a good degree of fluidity. More information about the process by which to make your own models later.
